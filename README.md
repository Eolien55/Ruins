# Ruins

Ruins is a Unity video game. It was first prototyped in GameMaker, but the codebase soon became too large, and as the project was evolving, just wrong. It was decided to re-write it in C#, for ease of use (free for individual usage, unlike GameMaker) and better speed than those achievable by our old framework.

## Testing
Note that you cannot run the game just by compiling it. If you do so, the game won't save. This is for testing / debugging purpose.

## Contributing
You can contribute to the game by opening issues / pull requests.
